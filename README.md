## 📌 About Me

## 📌 About Me

I'm Adnachiel Bismarck Avendaño Chávez, a Data Analyst and Applied Physics Engineer based in Oaxaca, Mexico. I specialize in extracting, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing complex datasets across healthcare, engineering, and e-commerce domains. My technical toolkit includes Python, SQL, Power BI, R, and Google Cloud Platform, with a strong foundation in statistics, dynamic systems modeling, and machine learning.

I’ve worked on projects ranging from hospital data optimization and inventory diagnostics to web scraping for electronics retailers in India and predictive modeling using LSTM-PINN. My approach blends analytical rigor with strategic thinking, aiming to support data-driven decision-making in dynamic environments.

Key strengths:
- Executive reporting and dashboard design  
- Process automation and reproducible workflows  
- Web scraping and API integration for market insights  
- Geospatial and sustainability analytics  
- Clear documentation and technical storytelling  

I'm currently open to BI and analytics opportunities—nationally or internationally—that value both technical depth and business impact.
